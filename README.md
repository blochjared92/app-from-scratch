# Building and Deploying a New Cloud App from Scratch

This is the source code and supporting libraries for the "[Building and Deploying a New Cloud App from Scratch](https://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/building-and-deploying-a-new-cloud-app-from-scratch)" workshop.

## Workshop Details

In this workshop I got to visualize the build and deployment of a modern cloud application from scratch!
Using Visual Studio and Azure, I learned how to build a modern application from the ground up
and deploy it to the cloud using the latest techniques.
I looked at some of the best practices in designing and building the application,
testing my code, and deploying the application, so I can set up for success later.
